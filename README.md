# Microfluidics Simulation Application


 This microfluidic simulation tool models fluid flow in microchannels, specifically designed to simulate laminar flow in rectangular and circular channels. The tool uses Poiseuille flow and Hagen-Poiseuille flow models to compute and visualize the velocity profiles of fluids in microfluidic systems.

This project was created in conjunction with my research on kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) fragments, where I conducted experiments in rectangular microfluidic channels. The purpose of this tool is to simulate flow in these channels and compare the predicted flow profiles with the actual molecular tracking data from my kDNA experiments. By analyzing both the simulated and experimental data, this project aims to identify the type of flow in the channels used for my research.

The simulation allows for customizable input parameters, including channel dimensions, flow rates, and fluid viscosity. It generates plots of the velocity profile based on these inputs, making it easy to visualize flow behavior in different microfluidic geometries.

In future versions, the tool will be expanded to include more complex geometries and additional features, such as multi-phase flow and mixing efficiency.
